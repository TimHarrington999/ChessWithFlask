This is a tentative list of what I intend to work on next for the project.

Frontend: 
- add dummy pieces to game to get movement functionality down.
- find icons for each chess piece and arrange them on the board.
- create a representation of the board to enable communication with the backend.

Backend:
- Create game controller that will manage the details of the chess game.
- refine interface between front/back end.
- add AI (Minimax) to play against the player.
